### Take-away ordering application

This small application allows you to select menu items (Rhubarb based dishes!) to add to your basket. It incorporated basic implementation of the Twilio API to send text messages on 'checkout'.

A simple exercise in creating a small Sinatra application and incorporating the use of an API. 

Run RSpec to see the development of the logic in the models:

$ rspec
